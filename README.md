# iRail

This is the WebClient hosted at [http://iRail.be]. Unstable versions can be found at [http://dev.iRail.be] (bleeding edge). It's built upon the iRail api ([http://api.iRail.be]) which delivers public transport information to online applications, free of charge and free as in beer.

This is the WebClient 2.0 branch. The design has been made by Dennis Kestelle. People who brought this client to life:

 * Muhammet "Mojo" Kilic <muhammet aŧ zeropoint.IT>
 * Pieter Colpaert <pieter aŧ iRail.be>

More information can be found on [Project iRail](http://project.irail.be/).
