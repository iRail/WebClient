ARCHITECTURE
-------------

We have a MVC architecture. This means we have a Model (in the datamodel/ dir), which will fetch all our data, we have a View (in the templates/ dir) which contains all generate client-code (probably css/js/html/images) and last but not least, there is the Controler (in the requesthandlers/ dir) which will be the start for every page-load.

iRail/WebClient$ ls
file .htaccess		Contains the rewrite rules to have nice URLs
file config.php		Configuration such as API-url and useragent
file favicon.ico 	Little icon for your browser	
file Page.class.php	Pages will be gnerated through this class
file README.md		More information
dir  i18n/	 	Internationalisation files: needed for translation
dir  datamodel/	 	our Model
dir  requesthandlers/	our Controllers
dir  templates/		our Views

Since the web works with page-loads we always have a certain dataflow from input(a HTTP-request) to output (HTTP-response):

Opening the main page:
requesthandlers/controller.php â†’ will create an APICall
